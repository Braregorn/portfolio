              Welcome to my website! My name is Nicholas Lin and I'm glad you've taken the time out of your
              day to learn a little bit more about me. One of my passions is fitness and nutrition and I'm
              super happy to be able to share that excitement with you. On the following pages, I'll share my philosophy on both health and exercise. I'll give a general guide
              about where to start if someone wanted to get into the gym and start working on themselves. Additionally, I'll
              include two of my favorite recipes right now that have allowed me to have a truly sustainable diet. Hopefully
              the information finds you well as this is just one of the topics that I feel I truly have experienced thoroughly.
              I would love for others to be able to have the same enjoyment as I do when it comes to pursuing a sustainable and
              healthy lifestyle and hopefully this short interest site can help you realize your own potential!
